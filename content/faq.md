## 1. IS THAT A CAMERA? 

While some total stations do have the capability to take pictures, I assure you, no. No it's not a camera and it is not taking pictures of you. We're much to busy working to bother with that sort of thing. The total station is the foundation of surveying. Preceeded by theodolites and chains, in today's modern world a robotic total station does the work of what would have taken a whole crew. It uses a laser to measure distances, and fancy technology inside to measure angles. Distance, angles, and known points allow a surveyor determine the position of things relative to other things. 


## 2. WHY ARE SURVEYS SO EXPENSIVE?

A lot goes into a survey that the public wont see. There is often an imbalance towards office work, where a surveyor must do research and calculations to determine where things should be before the field crew ever sees the site. Once the field crew completes the measurements of the necessary components of a survey then the data goes back into the office for analysis and processing. That is, and a big if here, if the field crew isn't stymied by any of the many obstacles they face. Destroyed monuments, inaccessible areas, rowdy neighbors, the weather, and the list goes on. It's a weird skill but we're really good at it.

## 3. WHY ARE YOU SURVEYING SO FAR FROM WHERE THE CLIENTS PROPERTY IS?

A good example of why a surveyor may be miles from the clients site is of a neighborhood block. A lot of subdivisions in Santa Cruz are very old. Any many times people living there have had no need for a survey because they "know" where the property lines are. However, due diligence requires a surveyor to maintain not only their clients property rights, but the rights of everyone surrounding them. So with a neighborhood block, its important to make sure that a measurement from the front of a property matches up with where you expect the backyard neighbors property should end up. If not, it has to be resolved. You'd be surprised how many urban lots are lacking monumentation and have issues being resolved.

## 1. IS THAT A CAMERA? 

While some modern total stations include imaging capabilities, they are not cameras and are not used to photograph people. Their purpose is precise measurement, not observation.

The total station is the foundational instrument of modern land surveying. Building on earlier tools lsuch as chains and theodolites, today’s robotic total stations use laser technology to measure distances and angles with extreme precision—down to seconds of arc. For reference, there are 1,296,000 arcseconds in one full circle.

By combining measured distances and angles referenced to known control points, total stations allow surveyors to accurately determine the position of features relative to one another, forming the basis of reliable spatial data.


## 2. WHY ARE SURVEYS SO EXPENSIVE?

A significant portion of the surveying process occurs beyond what is visible in the field. Survey work often begins in the office, where historical research and technical calculations are performed to establish the framework for field operations.

After field measurements are collected, the data returns to the office for analysis, verification, and final processing. This workflow assumes field conditions allow for uninterrupted work—an assumption that is not always met. Surveyors regularly contend with challenges such as disturbed or missing monuments, limited site access, environmental conditions, and other unforeseen obstacles.


## 3. WHY DOES IT REQUIRE LICENSURE TO PERFORM A SURVEY?
Due diligence includes researching historical records, checking existing boundary markers, and verifying measurements with adjoining properties. This ensures your survey is accurate, legally defensible, and consistent with surrounding lots.

Successfully navigating these complexities requires technical skill, adaptability, and experience. All qualities essential to delivering accurate and defensible survey results.


## 4. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE BOUNDARY ISSUES IN DEVELOPED NEIGHBORHOODS?
Surprisingly so. Many urban lots in old subdivisions lack clear monuments, and property lines can be ambiguous. Surveyors identify and resolve these discrepancies so your property boundaries are correctly defined.
